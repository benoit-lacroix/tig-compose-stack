# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
# them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})


# Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
[global_tags]
  # dc = "us-east-1" # will tag all metrics with dc=us-east-1
  # rack = "1a"
  ## Environment variables can be used as tags, and throughout the config file
  # user = "$USER"

# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "1s"
  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true

  ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
  ## metric_batch_size metrics.
  ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
  metric_batch_size = 1000

  ## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
  ## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
  ## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
  metric_buffer_limit = 10000

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "0s"

  ## Collection offset is used to shift the collection by the given amount.
  ## This can be be used to avoid many plugins querying constraint devices
  ## at the same time by manually scheduling them in time.
  # collection_offset = "0s"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
  ## flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "1s"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "0s"

  ## Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified. Precision is
  ## specified as an interval with an integer + unit (e.g. 0s, 10ms, 2us, 4s).
  ## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".
  ##
  ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
  ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s:
  ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
  ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
  ##
  ## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
  ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
  precision = "0s"

  ## Log at debug level.
  # debug = false
  ## Log only error level messages.
  # quiet = false

  ## Log target controls the destination for logs and can be one of "file",
  ## "stderr" or, on Windows, "eventlog".  When set to "file", the output file
  ## is determined by the "logfile" setting.
  # logtarget = "file"

  ## Name of the file to be logged to when using the "file" logtarget.  If set to
  ## the empty string then logs are written to stderr.
  # logfile = ""

  ## The logfile will be rotated after the time interval specified.  When set
  ## to 0 no time based rotation is performed.  Logs are rotated only when
  ## written to, if there is no log activity rotation may be delayed.
  # logfile_rotation_interval = "0h"

  ## The logfile will be rotated when it becomes larger than the specified
  ## size.  When set to 0 no size based rotation is performed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_size = "0MB"

  ## Maximum number of rotated archives to keep, any older logs are deleted.
  ## If set to -1, no archives are removed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_archives = 5

  ## Pick a timezone to use when logging or type 'local' for local time.
  ## Example: America/Chicago
  # log_with_timezone = ""

  ## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
  hostname = "telegraf-mqtt-publisher"
  ## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
  omit_hostname = false

  ## Method of translating SNMP objects. Can be "netsnmp" (deprecated) which
  ## translates by calling external programs snmptranslate and snmptable,
  ## or "gosmi" which translates using the built-in gosmi library.
  # snmp_translator = "netsnmp"

  ## Name of the file to load the state of plugins from and store the state to.
  ## If uncommented and not empty, this file will be used to save the state of
  ## stateful plugins on termination of Telegraf. If the file exists on start,
  ## the state in the file will be restored for the plugins.
  # statefile = ""

###############################################################################


# Configuration for MQTT server to send metrics to
[[outputs.mqtt]]
  ## MQTT Brokers
  ## The list of brokers should only include the hostname or IP address and the
  ## port to the broker. This should follow the format `[{scheme}://]{host}:{port}`. For
  ## example, `localhost:1883` or `mqtt://localhost:1883`.
  ## Scheme can be any of the following: tcp://, mqtt://, tls://, mqtts://
  ## non-TLS and TLS servers can not be mix-and-matched.
  servers = ["mqtt://activemq:1883"]

  ## Protocol can be `3.1.1` or `5`. Default is `3.1.1`
  #procotol = "3.1.1"

  ## MQTT Topic for Producer Messages
  ## MQTT outputs send metrics to this topic format:
  ## {{ .TopicPrefix }}/{{ .Hostname }}/{{ .PluginName }}/{{ .Tag "tag_key" }}
  ## (e.g. prefix/web01.example.com/mem/some_tag_value)
  ## Each path segment accepts either a template placeholder, an environment variable, or a tag key
  ## of the form `{{.Tag "tag_key_name"}}`. Empty path elements as well as special MQTT characters
  ## (such as `+` or `#`) are invalid to form the topic name and will lead to an error.
  ## In case a tag is missing in the metric, that path segment omitted for the final topic.
  topic = "metrics/{{ .Hostname }}/{{ .PluginName }}"

  ## QoS policy for messages
  ## The mqtt QoS policy for sending messages.
  ## See https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q029090_.htm
  ##   0 = at most once
  ##   1 = at least once
  ##   2 = exactly once
  # qos = 2

  ## Keep Alive
  ## Defines the maximum length of time that the broker and client may not
  ## communicate. Defaults to 0 which turns the feature off.
  ##
  ## For version v2.0.12 and later mosquitto there is a bug
  ## (see https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2117), which requires
  ## this to be non-zero. As a reference eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang defaults to 30.
  # keep_alive = 0

  ## username and password to connect MQTT server.
  # username = "telegraf"
  # password = "metricsmetricsmetricsmetrics"

  ## client ID
  ## The unique client id to connect MQTT server. If this parameter is not set
  ## then a random ID is generated.
  client_id = "mqtt-publisher"

  ## Timeout for write operations. default: 5s
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"

  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false

  ## When true, metrics will be sent in one MQTT message per flush. Otherwise,
  ## metrics are written one metric per MQTT message.
  ## DEPRECATED: Use layout option instead
  # batch = false

  ## When true, metric will have RETAIN flag set, making broker cache entries until someone
  ## actually reads it
  # retain = false

  ## Layout of the topics published.
  ## The following choices are available:
  ##   non-batch -- send individual messages, one for each metric
  ##   batch     -- send all metric as a single message per MQTT topic
  ## NOTE: The following options will ignore the 'data_format' option and send single values
  ##   field     -- send individual messages for each field, appending its name to the metric topic
  ##   homie-v4  -- send metrics with fields and tags according to the 4.0.0 specs
  ##                see https://homieiot.github.io/specification/
  layout = "field"

  ## HOMIE specific settings
  ## The following options provide templates for setting the device name
  ## and the node-ID for the topics. Both options are MANDATORY and can contain
  ## {{ .PluginName }} (metric name), {{ .Tag "key"}} (tag reference to 'key')
  ## or constant strings. The templays MAY NOT contain slashes!
  # homie_device_name = ""
  # homie_node_id = ""

  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_OUTPUT.md
  data_format = "influx"

  ## Optional MQTT 5 publish properties
  ## These setting only apply if the "protocol" property is set to 5. This must
  ## be defined at the end of the plugin settings, otherwise TOML will assume
  ## anything else is part of this table. For more details on publish properties
  ## see the spec:
  ## https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901109

# Read metrics about disk IO by device
[[inputs.diskio]]
  ## By default, telegraf will gather stats for all devices including

  ##       disk synonyms like '/dev/disk/by-id'.

  #
  ## On systems which support it, device metadata can be added in the form of
  ## tags.
  ## Currently only Linux is supported via udev properties. You can view
  ## available properties for a device by running:
  ## 'udevadm info -q property -n /dev/sda'
  ## Note: Most, but not all, udev properties can be accessed this way. Properties
  ## that are currently inaccessible include DEVTYPE, DEVNAME, and DEVPATH.
  # device_tags = ["ID_FS_TYPE", "ID_FS_USAGE"]
  #
  ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
  ## name of the device via templates.
  ## The 'name_templates' parameter is a list of templates to try and apply to
  ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
  ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
